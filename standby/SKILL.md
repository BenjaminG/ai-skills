# Standby — Park a Blocked Task

Put a task on standby with a required reason describing what it's waiting on.

## Configuration

```yaml
persistence:
  tasksDir: "~/.claude/daily-tasks"
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse Arguments

Split `$ARGUMENTS` into an identifier and a reason:

- **Identifier:** first token — either a numeric task ID or a Jira key pattern (e.g., `RGI-265`, `MITB-123`).
- **Reason:** everything after the identifier (strip surrounding quotes if present).

**If no reason provided:**

```
⛔ A reason is required. What are you waiting on?
   Example: /standby 3 "waiting on Claire's design review"
   Example: /standby RGI-265 "needs data pipeline rerun"
```

**Stop here.**

**If no identifier provided:** check for a single `in_progress` task and use that automatically. If zero or multiple `in_progress` tasks, ask for an explicit task ID. **Stop here** if ambiguous.

### 2. Load Task File

Read today's task file:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/daily-tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json 2>/dev/null
```

If no file exists: "No task file for today. Run `/morning-standup` first." **Stop.**

Parse the JSON. Find the target task by numeric ID or `jira_key`.

If not found: "Task #N not found. Today has tasks 1-M." **Stop.**

### 3. Validate Transition

| Current status | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| `done` | Reject: "Task #N is already done. Can't put a completed task on standby." Stop. |
| `skipped` | Reject: "Task #N was skipped. Use `/next N` to pick it up first." Stop. |
| `standby` (no new reason) | Show current reason: "Task #N is already on standby. Waiting on: {waiting_on}. Use `/unblock N` to activate it, or re-run `/standby N \"new reason\"` to update the reason." Stop. |
| `standby` (with new reason) | Update `waiting_on` and `paused_at` in place. Proceed. |
| `pending` or `in_progress` | Proceed. |

### 4. Update Task

Read the current task file (fresh read), update the target task:
- Set `status` to `"standby"`
- Set `waiting_on` to the parsed reason string
- Set `paused_at` to current ISO timestamp (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`)
- Preserve `started_at` as-is (do not clear — needed for unblock logic)
- Update `updated_at` on the root object

Write the updated JSON back using the **Write tool**.

### 5. Confirm

Display:

```
⏸️  Task #N on standby: $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
   └─ Waiting on: $REASON
```

Show compact remaining actionable tasks (status `pending` or `in_progress` only — exclude `standby` tasks):

```
Remaining:
  #N. [TIER] $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
  #N. [TIER] $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
```

If any standby tasks exist (including the one just parked), add a line:

```
⏸ N task(s) on standby — run /unblock to activate when ready
```

Suggest next actionable task:

```
👉 Next up: Task #N ($JIRA_KEY) — $SUMMARY
   Run /next to pick it up.
```

If no actionable tasks remain:

```
📭 No actionable tasks remaining.
   ⏸ N task(s) on standby — run /unblock when unblocked, or /morning-standup to refresh.
```

## Edge Cases

- **`/standby` with no identifier and no `in_progress` task:** Ask for explicit ID. Stop.
- **`/standby` on already-standby task with new reason:** Update `waiting_on` and `paused_at`. Confirm update.
- **`/standby` on already-standby task without new reason:** Show current reason, suggest `/unblock`. Stop.
- **Task ID doesn't exist:** "Task #N not found. Today has tasks 1-M."
- **File write fails:** Report error, do not silently lose the update.
