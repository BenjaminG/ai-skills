# Done — Complete Current Task

Mark a task as completed in today's task file and show remaining work.

## Configuration

```yaml
persistence:
  tasksDir: "~/.claude/daily-tasks"
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Load Task File

Read today's task file:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/daily-tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json 2>/dev/null
```

If no file exists: "No task file for today. Nothing to mark as done." **Stop here.**

Parse the JSON.

### 2. Identify Task to Complete

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number:** target that task ID.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` matches a Jira key pattern** (e.g., `RGI-265`): find the task with matching `jira_key`.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:** find the task with `status: "in_progress"`.
- If multiple tasks are `in_progress`, list them and ask which one to complete.
- If no task is `in_progress`: "No task currently in progress. Specify a task ID: `/daily-done 3`"
- **Stop here** if unable to identify a single task.

**Validation:**
- If the selected task has `status: "done"`: "Task #N is already done."
- If the selected task ID doesn't exist: "Task #N not found. Today has tasks 1-M."
- If the selected task has `status: "pending"` (never started): Mark as done anyway, but note: "Task #N was never started — marking as done directly."
- If the selected task has `status: "standby"`: Warn but proceed: "⚠️ Task #N is on standby (waiting on: {waiting_on}). Marking as done anyway."

### 3. Mark as Done

Read the current task file, update the target task:
- Set `status` to `"done"`
- Set `completed_at` to current ISO timestamp (use `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`)
- Set `waiting_on` to `null` and `paused_at` to `null` (clean up any standby fields)
- Update `updated_at` on the root object

Write the updated JSON back using the **Write tool**.

### 4. Show Completion Summary

Display:

```
✅ Task #N done: $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
```

If `started_at` exists, calculate and show duration:

```
   ⏱️  Duration: Xh Ym
```

Show overall progress:

```
📋 Progress: N/M tasks done today
```

### 5. Show Next Task

List remaining actionable tasks (`pending` or `in_progress` only — exclude `standby`):

```
Remaining:
  #N. [TIER] $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
  #N. [TIER] $JIRA_KEY — $SUMMARY
```

If any standby tasks exist, add a note:

```
⏸ N task(s) on standby — run /daily-unblock to activate when ready
```

Suggest the next task:

```
👉 Next up: Task #N ($JIRA_KEY) — $SUMMARY
   Run /daily-next to pick it up, or /daily-next M for a different task.
```

### 6. All Done State

If no pending or in-progress tasks remain (standby tasks don't count):

```
🎉 All tasks for today are done!

📋 Final: M/M complete
⏱️  Total tracked time: Xh Ym (sum of all tasks with started_at and completed_at)

Consider:
  - Running /daily-standup to refresh and check for new items
  - Checking Jira backlog for new work
```

## Edge Cases

- **Multiple `in_progress` tasks, no argument**: List all in-progress tasks with IDs and ask which to complete. Do not guess.
- **Task is `skipped`**: Allow marking as `done` — change status from `skipped` to `done`.
- **Task is `standby`**: Warn about standby state but allow marking as `done`. Clear `waiting_on` and `paused_at`.
- **File write fails**: Report error, do not silently lose the update.
- **Concurrent modification**: Read-then-write is sufficient for single-user workflow. If the file was modified between read and write, the latest write wins.
